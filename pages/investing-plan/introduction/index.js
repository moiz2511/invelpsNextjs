          Whether you&apos;re saving for your first car or you want to live
          abroad for a semester, some financial dreams are bigger than others.
          If the money seems out of reach, it may be time to create a plan—or a
          roadmap. Here are some steps you can take:
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>1. Know where you want to go:</b> Define what you want to save for.
          This is called setting a goal. Write your goal down—this small step
          can help you reach it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2. Map it out:</b>
           To figure how to get from point A to point B, write down how much
          money you will need to reach your goal. Then subtract what you already
          have saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>3. Fuel up: </b>Once you have a number in mind, you need a way
          reach it. Whether it&apos;s through a part-time job, allowance, gifts,
          or even starting a small business, making and saving money will take
          work and some time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>4. Pack up the car:</b>
           Be sure to sock your money away somewhere safe. If you will need the
          money soon, then a savings or cash management account makes sense. But
          if your goal is going to take a longer time to reach, you may even
          consider investing your money instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you have a roadmap, it&apos;s much easier to reach a goal. With a
          plan in hand, you&apos;ll be cruising along in no time.
        </p>
